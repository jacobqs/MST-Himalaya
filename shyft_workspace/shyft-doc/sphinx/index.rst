The open source SHyFT project contains four individual Python packages:

1. ``shyft.hydrology`` which provides spatially distributed conceptual hydrologic models
2. ``shyft.energy-market`` which provides elements to build an energy market model
3. ``shyft.time-series`` which provides a high performance generic time-series framework
4. ``shyft.dashboard`` which provides web components to display time series using `Bokeh <https://bokeh.org/>`_.
