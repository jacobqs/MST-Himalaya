Help make the Shyft toolbox better
************************************

We always need help improving documentation, preparing good examples and of course extending the code base.

The toolbox is developed for both Unix-like and Windows operating systems and therefore the code base is platform
independent. The core code is written in C++ using `Boost Python <http://boostorg.github.io/python/doc/html/index.html>`_
to enable interoperability in form of Python wrappers. :ref:`PackageDashboard` provides web components
and uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is based on the Python web visualization library `Bokeh <https://bokeh.org/>`_.

We group members of the Shyft community into several categories:

- **users** are those interested in using Shyft for time-series, dashboard, energy-market or hydrologic analysis.
- **contributers** are those who will explore the Python API and may contribute back to the project in the form of
  documentation and examples.
- **developers** are those who are interested in the C++ core, and are interested in creating their own algorithms.
  Advance programming skills and familiarity are required.

Please check the `Shyft wiki on our GitLab site <https://gitlab.com/shyft-os/shyft/wikis/home>`_ for more information
on how to participate in development.
