Package shyft
*************

The Python package ``shyft`` provides a high performance framework for spatially distributed conceptual hydrologic
models for use in the the energy-market domain. The hydrological forecasting model framework allows for simulation
of different algorithms in a highly efficient manner, while providing an interface to conduct more explorative
evaluations of the hydrologic performance of the available algorithms. ``shyft`` is not simply a model, nor is it a
distinct "framework".

The package is platform independent and can be installed the following way:

1. using **pip** from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/shyft/>`_

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install shyft

2. using **anaconda/conda** from the `Shyft channel <https://anaconda.org/shyft-os/shyft>`_

   .. code-block:: bash

      conda install -c shyft-os shyft

.. note::

   This package contains the individually available :ref:`PackageTimeSeries` and :ref:`PackageDashboard`.
