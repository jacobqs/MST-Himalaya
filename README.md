The water supply from the Himalayan and Tibetan Plateau is of great importance for millions of people (Bookhagen & Burbank 2010). The water from this region provides drinking water, supports agricultural demands, is used for hydropower generation and other agro-economic activities (Ménégoz et al. 2013). The countries in the High Mountain Asia (HMA) region have a huge potential for developing hydropower making the shift towards a greener economy more feasible.

The Bundhi-Gandaki catchment is located in the Gorkha district of Nepal. The catch- ment has a high mean annual precipitation of 1495 mm and extremely high spatial vari- ation in elevation (Devkota et al. 2017). For example, the lowest point is at 479 meters above sea level (m.a.s.l.) at Arughat hydrological station and the highest at Manaslu mountain 8163 m.a.s.l. The combination of high precipitation rate and steep gradients in elevation makes the region of superior interest for hydropower. The installed capacity is 1200 megawatt (MW) with an average energy generation of 3383 gigawatt-hours (GWh).

However, the hydropower potential is dependent on the climatic conditions in precipi- tation, evaporation, temperature and snow/ice in the catchment (Edenhofer et al. 2011). Climate change has serious implications fro hydropower production (Dandekhya et al. 2017). Changing rainfall pattern and increased temperatures will affect power genera- tion. The retreat of glaciers, expansion of glacial lakes and changes in the seasonality and intensity of rainfall is identifies as factors that will affect the power generation in the future (Dandekhya et al. 2017). The region is also threatened by Glacial Lake Out- burst Floods (GLOFs), that can cause devastating floods downstream (Dandekhya et al. 2017). In addition, the extremely heterogeneous topography of the catchment makes it challenging to get accurate measurements of meteorological variables (Pellicciotti et al. 2012). The scarcity of data makes the discharge predictions, which lies the foundation for hydropower, prone to errors. It is impossible to make observations at all high levels, especially for snow over and depth. For this reason, satellite observations and reanalysis data sets important for decision-making processes. Furthermore, different precipitation patterns on the leeward and windward sides of the catchment needs to taken into account in simulations.

Hydrological modelling in the region is challenging due to the steep gradients in eleva- tion, the highly heterogeneous distribuiton of hydrometeorological variables the marked seasonality driven by the Indian Monsoon and contrasting moisture regimes between the Tibetan Plateau and regions near the Indian Ocean (Bhattarai et al. 2020). Climate change will also likely lead to changes in the regional water balance components (Bhat- tarai et al. 2020). The quality of the discharge simulations for the region remains a challenge (Rochester 2010, Engeland et al. 2016, Kauffeldt et al. 2016), because the input data and choice of model will greatly affect the outcome (Kauffeldt et al. 2016).
