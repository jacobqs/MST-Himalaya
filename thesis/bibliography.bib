	abstract = {Distributed and semi-distributed hydrological modeling approaches commonly involve the discretization of a catchment into several modeling elements. Although some modeling studies were conducted using triangulated irregular networks (TINs) previously, little attention has been given to assess the impact of TINs as compared to the standard catchment discretization techniques. Here, we examine how different catchment discretization approaches and radiation forcings influence hydrological simulation results. Three catchment discretization methods, i.e., elevation zones (Hypsograph) (HYP), regular square grid (SqGrid), and TIN, were evaluated in a highly steep and glacierized Marsyangdi-2 river catchment, central Himalaya, Nepal. To evaluate the impact of radiation on model response, shortwave radiation was converted using two approaches: one with the measured solar radiation assuming a horizontal surface and another with a translation to slopes. The results indicate that the catchment discretization has a great impact on simulation results. Evaluation of the simulated streamflow value using Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) and log-transformed Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (LnNSE) shows that highest model performance was obtained when using TIN followed by HYP (during the high flow condition) and SqGrid (during the low flow condition). Similar order of precedence in relative model performance was obtained both during the calibration and validation periods. Snow simulated from the TIN-based discretized models was validated with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow products. Critical Success Indexes (CSI) between TIN-based discretized model snow simulation and MODIS snow were found satisfactory. Bias in catchment average snow cover area from the models with and without using imputed radiation is less than two percent, but implementation of imputed radiation into the Statkraft Hydrological Forecasting Toolbox (Shyft) gives better CSI with MODIS snow.},

	abstract = {The Himalayan region, a major source of fresh water, is recognized as a water tower of the world. Many perennial rivers originate from Nepal Himalaya, located in the central part of the Himalayan region. Snowmelt water is essential freshwater for living, whereas it poses flood disaster potential, which is a major challenge for sustainable development. Climate change also largely affects snowmelt hydrology. Therefore, river discharge measurement requires crucial attention in the face of climate change, particularly in the Himalayan region. The snowmelt runoff model (SRM) is a frequently used method to measure river discharge in snow-fed mountain river basins. This study attempts to investigate snowmelt contribution in the overall discharge of the Budhi Gandaki River Basin (BGRB) using satellite remote sensing data products through the application of the SRM model. The model outputs were validated based on station measured river discharge data. The results show that SRM performed well in the study basin with a coefficient of determination (R2) {\textgreater}0.880. Moreover, this study found that the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover data and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) meteorological datasets are highly applicable to the SRM in the Himalayan region. The study also shows that snow days have slightly decreased in the last three years, hence snowmelt contribution in overall discharge has decreased slightly in the study area. Finally, this study concludes that MOD10A2 and ECMWF precipitation and two-meter temperature products are highly applicable to measure snowmelt and associated discharge through SRM in the BGRB. Moreover, it also helps with proper freshwater planning, efficient use of winter water flow, and mitigating and preventive measures for the flood disaster.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The WFDE5 dataset has been generated using the WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) methodology applied to surface meteorological variables from the ERA5 reanalysis. The WFDEI dataset had previously been generated by applying the WFD methodology to ERA-Interim. The WFDE5 is provided at 0.5∘ spatial resolution but has higher temporal resolution (hourly) compared to WFDEI (3-hourly). It also has higher spatial variability since it was generated by aggregation of the higher-resolution ERA5 rather than by interpolation of the lower-resolution ERA-Interim data. Evaluation against meteorological observations at 13 globally distributed FLUXNET2015 sites shows that, on average, WFDE5 has lower mean absolute error and higher correlation than WFDEI for all variables. Bias-adjusted monthly precipitation totals of WFDE5 result in more plausible global hydrological water balance components when analysed in an uncalibrated hydrological model (WaterGAP) than with the use of raw ERA5 data for model forcing. The dataset, which can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.20d54e34 (C3S, 2020b), is distributed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) through its Climate Data Store (CDS, C3S, 2020a) and currently spans from the start of January 1979 to the end of 2018. The dataset has been produced using a number of CDS Toolbox applications, whose source code is available with the data – allowing users to regenerate part of the dataset or apply the same approach to other data. Future updates are expected spanning from 1950 to the most recent year. A sample of the complete dataset, which covers the whole of the year 2016, is accessible without registration to the CDS at https://doi.org/10.21957/935p-cj60 (Cucchi et al., 2020).},

targeted for use in hydropower production environments and research. The software enables
rapid development and implementation in operational settings and the capability to perform
distributed hydrologic modeling with multiple model and forcing configurations. Multiple models
may be built up through the creation of hydrologic algorithms from a library of well-known
routines or through the creation of new routines, each defined for processes such as
evapotranspiration, snow accumulation and melt, and soil water response. Key to the design of
Shyft is an application programming interface (API) that provides access to all components of the
framework (including the individual hydrologic routines) via Python, while maintaining high
computational performance as the algorithms are implemented in modern C++. The API allows for
rapid exploration of different model configurations and selection of an optimal forecast
model. Several different methods may be aggregated and composed, allowing direct intercomparison
of models and algorithms. In order to provide enterprise-level software, strong focus is given
to computational efficiency, code quality, documentation, and test coverage. Shyft is released open-source under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 and available at

Colored, particulate hide powder-azure, membrane fractions and soluble proteins such as hemoglobin, casein or albumin were susceptible to hydrolysis by the membraneous protease. Partial purification of the enzyme was accomplished through disc-gel electrophoresis on polyacrylamide in the presence of 0.25\% positively charged detergents like cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. An alkaline protease (pH 7.4) with properties similar to those of the erythrocyte enzyme was found in leucocytes. The similarity between the properties of the leucocytic and erythrocytic proteases and the correlation of the activity in erythrocyte membranes with content of white cells in these preparations, suggest that enzymatic activities in the contaminating leucocytes are responsible for the activity of membraneous proteases in erythrocytes.},

	abstract = {The analysis of water resources in Nepal identifies two critical impacts of climate change –GLOFs and variability of river runoff – both of which pose significant impacts not only to hydropower, but also to rural livelihoods and agriculture. Temperature differences are most pronounced during the dry winter season, and least during the height of the monsoon. Impacts on water resources and hydropower rank significantly higher than any other sector for several reasons. First, a number of impacts on water resources and hydropower are directly related to rising temperatures that have already been observed, and are projected to increase further over the coming decades. This includes glacier retreat that in turn causes both greater variability in stream flow and glacial lake outburst floods that pose significant risk to hydropower facilities, other infrastructure, and human settlements. GLOFs are not hypothetical; such events have already had significant impacts in Nepal. In this study over the Gandaki river basin, discharge of the rivers, temperature trends, and rainfall patterns are analyzed using data from meteorological stations of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), Government of Nepal. Similarly the hydrological stations over the major glacier rivers of the basin are examined. In the study area, some hydropower stations and their energy production fluctuations over the seasons reflect the climate change impact to the hydro energy production in Nepal.Key words: Climate change; GLOF; Hhydropower; DHMDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3126/jie.v8i1-2.5108Journal of the Institute of Engineering Vol. 8, No. 1\&2, 2010/2011Page: 160-173Uploaded Date: 20 July, 2011},

            More than 1.4 billion people depend on water from the Indus, Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yangtze, and Yellow rivers. Upstream snow and ice reserves of these basins, important in sustaining seasonal water availability, are likely to be affected substantially by climate change, but to what extent is yet unclear. Here, we show that meltwater is extremely important in the Indus basin and important for the Brahmaputra basin, but plays only a modest role for the Ganges, Yangtze, and Yellow rivers. A huge difference also exists between basins in the extent to which climate change is predicted to affect water availability and food security. The Brahmaputra and Indus basins are most susceptible to reductions of flow, threatening the food security of an estimated 60 million people.},

	abstract = {The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) hydrological model has been used extensively by the scientific community to simulate varying hydro-climatic conditions and geo-physical environment. This study used SWAT to characterize the rainfall-runoff behaviour of a complex mountainous basin, the Budhigandaki River Basin (BRB), in central Nepal. The specific objectives of this research were to: (i) assess the applicability of SWAT model in data scarce and complex mountainous river basin using well-established performance indicators; and (ii) generate spatially distributed flows and evaluate the water balance at the sub-basin level. The BRB was discretised into 16 sub-basins and 344 hydrological response units (HRUs) and calibration and validation was carried out at Arughat using daily flow data of 20 years and 10 years, respectively. Moreover, this study carried out additional validation at three supplementary points at which the study team collected primary river flow data. Four statistical indicators: Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), percent bias (PBIAS), ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR) and Kling Gupta efficiency (KGE) have been used for the model evaluation. Calibration and validation results rank the model performance as “very good”. This study estimated the mean annual flow at BRB outlet to be 240 m3/s and annual precipitation 1528 mm with distinct seasonal variability. Snowmelt contributes 20\% of the total flow at the basin outlet during the pre-monsoon and 8\% in the post monsoon period. The 90\%, 40\% and 10\% exceedance flows were calculated to be 39, 126 and 453 m3/s respectively. This study provides additional evidence to the SWAT diaspora of its applicability to simulate the rainfall-runoff characteristics of such a complex mountainous catchment. The findings will be useful for hydrologists and planners in general to utilize the available water rationally in the times to come and particularly, to harness the hydroelectric potential of the basin.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Snow lying on top of sea ice plays an important role in the radiation budget because of its high albedo and the Arctic freshwater budget, and it influences the Arctic climate: it is a fundamental climate variable. Importantly, accurate snow depth products are required to convert satellite altimeter measurements of ice freeboard to sea ice thickness (SIT). Due to the harsh environment and challenging accessibility, in situ measurements of snow depth are sparse. The quasi-synoptic frequent repeat coverage provided by satellite measurements offers the best approach to regularly monitor snow depth on sea ice. A number of algorithms are based on satellite microwave radiometry measurements and simple empirical relationships. Reducing their uncertainty remains a major challenge. A High Priority Candidate Mission called the Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer (CIMR) is now being studied at the European Space Agency. CIMR proposes a conically scanning radiometer having a swath {\textgreater}1900 km and including channels at 1.4, 6.9, 10.65, 18.7 and 36.5 GHz on the same platform. It will fly in a high-inclination dawn–dusk orbit coordinated with the MetOp-SG(B). As part of the preparation for the CIMR mission, we explore a new approach to retrieve snow depth on sea ice from multi-frequency satellite microwave radiometer measurements using a neural network approach. Neural networks have proven to reach high accuracies in other domains and excel in handling complex, non-linear relationships. We propose one neural network that only relies on AMSR2 channel brightness temperature data input and another one using both AMSR2 and SMOS data as input. We evaluate our results from the neural network approach using airborne snow depth measurements from Operation IceBridge (OIB) campaigns and compare them to products from three other established snow depth algorithms. We show that both our neural networks outperform the other algorithms in terms of accuracy, when compared to the OIB data and we demonstrate that plausible results are obtained even outside the algorithm training period and area. We then convert CryoSat freeboard measurements to SIT using different snow products including the snow depth from our networks. We confirm that a more accurate snow depth product derived using our neural networks leads to more accurate estimates of SIT, when compared to the SIT measured by a laser altimeter at the OIB campaign. Our network with additional SMOS input yields even higher accuracies, but has the disadvantage of a larger “hole at the pole”. Our neural network approaches are applicable over the whole Arctic, capturing first-year ice and multi-year ice conditions throughout winter. Once the networks are designed and trained, they are fast and easy to use. The combined AMSR2 + SMOS neural network is particularly important as a precursor demonstration for the Copernicus CIMR candidate mission highlighting the benefit of CIMR.},

We discuss the specifics of how changes in the reanalysis and processing have led to improvement over the WFD. We attribute improvements in precipitation and wind speed to the latest reanalysis basis data and improved downward shortwave fluxes to the changes in the aerosol corrections. Covering 1979–2012, the WFDEI will allow more thorough comparisons of hydrological and Earth System model outputs with hydrologically and phenologically relevant satellite products than using the WFD.},

	abstract = {The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was flown aboard the space shuttle Endeavour February 11-22, 2000. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) participated in an international project to acquire radar data which were used to create the first near-global set of land elevations. The radars used during the SRTM mission were actually developed and flown on two Endeavour missions in 1994. The C-band Spaceborne Imaging Radar and the X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR) hardware were used on board the space shuttle in April and October 1994 to gather data about Earth's environment. The technology was modified for the SRTM mission to collect interferometric radar, which compared two radar images or signals taken at slightly different angles. This mission used single-pass interferometry, which acquired two signals at the same time by using two different radar antennas. An antenna located on board the space shuttle collected one data set and the other data set was collected by an antenna located at the end of a 60-meter mast that extended from the shuttle. Differences between the two signals allowed for the calculation of surface elevation. Endeavour orbited Earth 16 times each day during the 11-day mission, completing 176 orbits. SRTM successfully collected radar data over 80\% of the Earth's land surface between 60 degrees north and 56 degrees south latitude with data points posted every 1 arc-second (approximately 30 meters).},
